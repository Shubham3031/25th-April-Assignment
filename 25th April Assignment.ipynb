    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are important concepts in linear algebra that are used in a variety of applications,\n",

    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, an eigenvector of a matrix A is a non-zero vector v such that when A is multiplied by v, the\n",
    "result is a scalar multiple of v, denoted by λ. That is, Av = λv. The scalar λ is called the eigenvalue of A \n",
    "corresponding to the eigenvector v.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is an example to illustrate the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the matrix A = [2 1; 1 2]. We can find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of A as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix. We have:\n",

    "So the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 3.\n",

    "This leads to the system of equations x + y = 0 and x + y = 0, which has a solution of x = -y. So any\n",

    "For λ2 = 3, we have:\n",

    "A square matrix A is diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach if and only if it has n linearly \n",

    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "Let A be an n x n square matrix with eigenvalues λ1, λ2, ..., λk, and let v1, v2, ..., vk be eigenvectors\n",
    "corresponding to these eigenvalues, respectively. Suppose that A is diagonalizable, i.e., it can be\n",

    "\n",
    "We can write any vector x as a linear combination of the eigenvectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = c1v1 + c2v2 + ... + ckvk\n",
    "\n",
    "where c1, c2, ..., ck are constants. Then, we can apply A to x:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ax = A(c1v1 + c2v2 + ... + ckvk)\n",
    "= c1Av1 + c2Av2 + ... + ckAvk\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that λ1(c1v1), λ2(c2v2), ..., λk(ckvk) are simply scalar multiples of the corresponding eigenvectors. \n",
    "Thus, we can rewrite the above equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ax = λ1y1 + λ2y2 + ... + λkyk\n",
    "\n",
    "where y1 = c1v1, y2 = c2v2, ..., yk = ckvk are the components of x along the eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if A is diagonalizable, then there exists an invertible matrix V such that A = VΛV^-1, where V has n\n",
    "linearly independent eigenvectors v1, v2, ..., vn. This implies that the columns of V are linearly independent, \n",
    "and thus the vectors y1, y2, ..., yk are also linearly independent.\n",

    "Conversely, suppose that A has n linearly independent eigenvectors. Then, we can construct a matrix V whose \n",
    "columns are these eigenvectors. Since the eigenvectors are linearly independent, the matrix V is invertible.\n",
    "Then, we can write A as A = VΛV^-1, where Λ is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the corresponding\n",
